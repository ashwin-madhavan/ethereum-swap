Introduction:
    This is my first attempt at learning blockchain technology. I followed
    the steps provided by Dapp university's beginner guide available on Youtube.

Overview:
    Developed a web blockchain application that was able to connect
    to a MetaMask crypto wallet and exchange my own "Ash" token for Ethereum
    and vice-versa.

Technicals:
    - Used Truffle(smart contract development framework) along with Solidity to
    generate Ethereum smart contracts, testing, and deployment.
    - To practice without real crypto I used Ganache, a development blockchain
    tool.
    - Created a front-end hosted on a local server to let users trade "Ash" and
    Ethereum tokens without the hassle of doing so in the terminal
